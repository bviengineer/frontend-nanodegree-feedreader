## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. In it's original state, it included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and an initial test suite! I added tests to ensure:
* The name and URL for each feed are not blank or missing
* The menu element is hidden by default and toggles between open and closed when clicked
* The initial feeds loaded are unique and are not duplicates, using asynchornous testing methods

## Takeaway
I have added to my skillset, the foundation of writing tests using Jasmine and the Red, Green, Refactor (TDD) methodology. Testing provides the benefit of understanding whehter new code will break or improve existing feature(s).
